*Tech stack:*
*Front-end:* React.js
*Backend:* Node.js, Express.js
*Authentication:* Firebase
*Database:* MongoDB
*Compiler API:* Sphere Engine Compilers (free trial ends: Jan. 29, 2022, 12:29 a.m.)

Note: I used Sphere Engine Compiler API to compile codes and I am using free-trial version of it. If I don't renew it, 
it will expire at Jan. 29, 2022, 12:29 a.m. So, compiler function won't work afterwards. But other functions should work as it should be.
